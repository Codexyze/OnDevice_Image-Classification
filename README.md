# 🖼️ On-Device Image Classification App  

**On-Device Image Classification** is a simple Android app built with **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**, powered by **TensorFlow Lite**.  
It uses an on-device machine learning model to classify images into categories such as **Cat, Horse, Truck, and Car**.  

This app demonstrates how to integrate **TensorFlow Lite models** in a modern Android application without requiring an internet connection.
